What is FlowScape®?

The FlowScape® solution continually machine learns network behavior to alert security analysts on anomalies in real time.

Who owns FlowScape®?

Webroot, the market leader in next-generation endpoint security and threat intelligence, acquired the assets of CyberFlow Analytics, an innovator in applying data science to network anomaly detection. This acquisition enhances Webroot’s ability to address the explosion of internet-connected devices and an increasingly complex threat landscape.

Where is FlowScape® available?
FlowScape technology sees beyond the endpoint across a variety of environments, such as cloud services, new device types (IoT), BYOD, and network infrastructures (including closed systems). The software-only solution deploys on premises or in the cloud to start detecting anomalies on day one, while getting more intelligent the longer it runs. FlowScape is available for custom integration and evaluation as part of an initial pilot program, with full availability and further product integrations expected in 2017.
